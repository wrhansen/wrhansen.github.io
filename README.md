## Overview

This is my blog site done using the following tech:

* hugo
* terminal theme (by panr)
* github actions
* hosted on github pages

## How to handle images

* put the image under the `static/resources/` directory in the repo
* use the `image` shortcode found [here](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal#built-in-shortcodes)
* set src to `/resources/<image-name.png>`
* when the site builds, you should now see your image.
