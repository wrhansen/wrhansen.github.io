## Background

I'm Wesley Hansen. I live in Holland, MI but have been working remotely since
2019. I'm a software engineer with over 10 years experience in
backend web development in the e-commerce and financial tech industries. I am
currently employed at eMoney Advisor where I am a tech lead on the Incentive
platform.

## Technology

I enjoy using [python](https://www.python.org/) and the
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework to build monoliths,
microservices and REST-like APIs. I like python and Django for
building systems both large and small because these technologies allow
developers to work incredibly efficiently while offering a massive pluggable
ecosystem that allows you to focus on the parts that make your app unique. It's
a joy to use Django's ORM to model data that's fit for SQL relational databases.
