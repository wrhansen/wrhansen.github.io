## Technology

This blog is written in markdown and uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static
site generator. I found a nice minimalist theme called [terminal]() that styles
the site the way you see here.

## Deployment

For simplicity and ease-of-use, I decided to host this blog on github pages and
take advantage of free static site hosting. You can find the contents of this
blog in the following repo: [link](https://github.com/wrhansen/wrhansen.github.io).
It's easy to use because github automatically builds and deploys anytime you
merge a new commit to the `main` branch.

Additionally, they allow the option to use your own custom domain for the URL
so I opted with my own domain: https://blog.wrhansen.dev/.
