When we first started using GroupMe for our chat, I was happy because it offered an API that you use to enhance the group chat. So I played around with it one weekend and the hansenbot was created.

I found a nice minimalist theme called terminal that styles the site the way you see here.

You can find the contents of this blog in the following repo: link. It&rsquo;s easy to use because github automatically builds and deploys anytime you merge a new commit to the main branch. …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>21.
