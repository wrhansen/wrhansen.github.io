When we first started using GroupMe for our chat, I was happy because it offered an API that you use to enhance the group chat. So I played around with it one weekend and the hansenbot was created.
The hansenbot is a pretty simple django app that exposes a hook URL that you can setup that GroupMe will forward all messages in your group to. …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>28.

Following this seemingly simple message is a week-long thread of thirty emails between several people and I am the lucky individual who gets added to the chain in hopes that I can resolve the issue. …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>08.

I purchased this book because I am passionate about good developer docs. I can easily spot good developer docs while working on a project but find it hard to write them myself in a way that is useful to myself and others. …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>27.

I found a nice minimalist theme called terminal that styles the site the way you see here.

You can find the contents of this blog in the following repo: link. It&rsquo;s easy to use because github automatically builds and deploys anytime you merge a new commit to the main branch. …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>21.

I live in Holland, MI but have been working remotely since 2019. I&rsquo;m a software engineer with over 10 years experience in backend web development in the e-commerce and financial tech industries. I am currently employed at eMoney Advisor where I am a tech lead on the Incentive platform.
Technology I enjoy using python and the Django framework to build monoliths, microservices and REST-like APIs. I like python and Django for building systems both large and small because these technologies allow developers to work incredibly efficiently while offering a massive pluggable ecosystem that allows you to focus on the parts that make your app unique. …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>20.
