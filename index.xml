&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m Wesley Hansen. I live in Holland, MI but have been working remotely since
2019 (before COVID). I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer with over 10 years experience in
backend web development in the e-commerce and financial tech industries. I am
currently employed at eMoney Advisor where I am a tech lead on the Incentive
platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="technology">Technology&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I enjoy using &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/">python&lt;/a> and the
&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django&lt;/a> framework to build monoliths,
microservices and REST-like APIs. I like python and Django for
building systems both large and small because these technologies allow
developers to work incredibly efficiently while offering a massive pluggable
ecosystem that allows you to focus on the parts that make your app unique. It&amp;rsquo;s
a joy to use Django&amp;rsquo;s ORM to model data that&amp;rsquo;s fit for SQL relational databases.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
