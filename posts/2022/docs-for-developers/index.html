Field Guide to Technical Writing</a> by Jared Bhatti, Zachary Sarah Corleissen,
Jen Lambourne, David Nunez, and Heidi Waterhouse. I purchased this book because
I am passionate about good developer docs. I can easily spot good developer docs
while working on a project but find it hard to write them myself in a way that
is useful to myself and others. This is a skill that I want to get better at so
I thought that this book would help.</p><h2 id=chapter-1-notes>Chapter 1 Notes</h2><p>This chapter is all about understanding your audience. This chapter seems geared
more towards client-focused documentation, where you have a product (like an API)
that you want clients to read. While this information is useful, and complete,
it seems to be outside the scope of what docs I typically write, which is
supplemental developer docs for internal teams to use to understand some service
that my team maintains. I&rsquo;ll definitely keep the points raised in this chapter
in mind for when I have a need for more client-focused documentation.</p><p>I like the idea of a friction log. The authors define it as:</p><blockquote><p>A <em>friction log</em> is a journal in which you try your software as a user would
and record your experiences. To record your experience, log each step
sequentially, noting the behavior you expect and the actual behavior of your
software.</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve never done anything explicity like this, however I can relate to the
process. To put it into my own experiences, my team typically writes docs for
the rest of the team to consume, as I mentioned before. We have an agreement on
the team, that if any dev reads docs and they don&rsquo;t quite make sense to the dev
reading them it is their responsibility to update the docs to make more sense.
This to me has some relevance to a <em>friction log</em> because you have a real-world
scenario where your intended audience is reading/working through your
documentation and they just happen to also have the ability to improve it
directly.</p><h2 id=overall-review>Overall Review</h2><p>After chapter 1 I found 90% of the book pretty standard information and got
nothing out of the information that I really thought was worthwhile. For this
reason I stopped taking individual chapter notes. There was one section in
one of the final chapters that explained some of the most common ways to
organize your docs site. It gave me some ideas of how to organize the docs that
I write for work in a way that makes the information grouped in a way that&rsquo;s easy
to find stuff.</p><p>I give this book 2 stars.</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>27. February 2022</span></p></article></div><footer id=footer><p class=copyright>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> and the
