When we first started using GroupMe for our chat, I was happy because it offered an API that you use to enhance the group chat. So I played around with it one weekend and the hansenbot was created.

I found a nice minimalist theme called terminal that styles the site the way you see here.
Deployment For simplicity and ease-of-use, I decided to host this blog on github pages and take advantage of free static site hosting. You can find the contents of this blog in the following repo: link. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use because github automatically builds and deploys anytime you merge a new commit to the main branch.</description></item></channel></rss>
