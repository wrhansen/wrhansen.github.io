When we first started using GroupMe for our chat, I was happy because it offered an API that you use to enhance the group chat. So I played around with it one weekend and the hansenbot was created.
The hansenbot is a pretty simple django app that exposes a hook URL that you can setup that GroupMe will forward all messages in your group to.</description></item></channel></rss>
